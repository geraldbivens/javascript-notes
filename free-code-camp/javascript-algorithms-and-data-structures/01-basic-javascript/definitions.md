# Definitions

## data

In computer science, _data_ is anything that is meaningful to the computer.

## variables

Variables allow computers to store and manipulate data in a dynamic fashion. They do this by using a "label" to point to the data rather than using the data itself. Any of the eight data types (in JavaScript) may be stored in a variable.

Variables are similar to the x and y variables you use in mathematics, which means they're a simple name to represent the data we want to refer to. Computer variables differ from mathematical variables in that they can store different values at different times.

## number

Number is a data type in JavaScript which represents numeric data.

## decimal numbers

Decimal numbers are sometimes referred to as _floating point_ numbers or _floats_.
