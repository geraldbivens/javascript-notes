# Definitions

## data

In computer science, _data_ is anything that is meaningful to the computer.

## variables

Variables allow computers to store and manipulate data in a dynamic fashion. They do this by using a "label" to point to the data rather than using the data itself. Any of the eight data types (in JavaScript) may be stored in a variable.

Variables are similar to the x and y variables you use in mathematics, which means they're a simple name to represent the data we want to refer to. Computer variables differ from mathematical variables in that they can store different values at different times.

## number

Number is a data type in JavaScript which represents numeric data.

## decimal numbers

Decimal numbers are sometimes referred to as _floating point_ numbers or _floats_.

## parameter

_Parameters_ are variables that act as placeholders for the values that are to be input to a function when it is called. When a function is defined, it is typically defined along with one or more parameters. The actual values that are input (or "passed") into a function when it is called are known as _arguments_

## scope

In JavaScript, _scope_ refers to the visibility of variables.

## global scope

Variables which are defined outside of a function blocvk have _Global_ scope. This means they can be seen everywhere in your JavaScript code.

Note: Variables which are declared without the var keyword are automatically created in the global scope.

## local scope

Variables which are declared within a function, as well as the function parameters, have _local_ scope. That means they are only visible within that function.

Note: Local scope takes precedence over global scope, so if you have two variables with the same name, for example, the variable with local scope will take precedence.
